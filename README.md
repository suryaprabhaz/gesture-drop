# Gesture Drop

A gesture-based application for quickly transferring text and images from your computer to your mobile device using hand gestures.

## Features

- Copy text on your computer and send it to your phone with a closed fist gesture

## How It Works

1. The desktop application (gesture_sender.py) monitors your webcam for hand gestures

4. Use different hand gestures on your mobile to control what content is displayed:
   - Open palm: Show both text and image
   - Thumbs up with fingers down: Show image only
